HW 1 – module “Networks”

<strong>Assignment 1: co-occurrence network of characters </strong>

Please choose one of the following options:

<ul>

 <li>Find an appealing <em>book</em> (for example, use the Project Gutenberg <u>https://www.gutenberg.org/</u> to find the text), parse the textual information in order to reconstruct the co-occurrence network of characters. For example, two characters can be linked if they appear in the same paragraph. <u>Examples</u> <u>for inspiration</u>: Lord of the Rings, War and Peace, Les Miserables, etc.</li>

 <li>Find a <em>screenplay</em> from your favorite movie (there are many resources can be found by Googling, for example, <u>https://thescriptsavant.com/free-moviescreenplays-am/</u>). Convert the .pdf to text using any online tool and parse the textual information to reconstruct the co-occurrence network of characters, where two characters can be linked if they appear in the same scene. Scenes are usually distinguished in bold notation. <u>Examples for inspiration</u>: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Zootopia, etc.</li>

</ul>




The only requirement here would be to choose a book or a movie with many characters (ideally more than 50). Tools for text processing were discussed on the first lecture.




<ul>

 <li>Find degree assortativity of the network and perform community detection using Louvain algorithm. Visualise the results. What can you tell from the them?</li>

 <li>Write the code for k-core decomposition (do not use the preprogrammed instance in <em>networkx</em>) and apply it to the network. What can you infer from it?</li>

 <li>Generate the preferential attachment (Barabasi-Albert) network with similar average degree and size. Perform same operations on this network. Describe any differences or similarities you can spot.</li>

</ul>
